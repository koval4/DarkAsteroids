 |- main menu state
 |- loading state
 |- dungeon generarion state
 |- player characters creation state
 |- action phase state
 |- world interaction state
 |- pause state
Implement text input widget
Make main menu UI
Make player character creation UI
Make simple npc FSM (seek & destroy)
Add game saves
 |- add Serializable class
Add Property class (contains formula of calculations, calculated value, uses listener pattern)
Implement entity-component system
Rework biologycal system
 |- relook pain shock
 |- add vital organs system
 |- add reactins to system changes
 |- add asphyxation effect
 |- add vomit
 |- add loss of consciousnes
Refactor items
 |- break inheritance system, use entity-components approach instead

 |- add material property
 |- add items quality
Make items recursive struct (item consists of multiple components)
Refactor UI system
 |- add Resizable class
 |- add abstract WidgetsContainer class
 |- add layouts (inherited from WidgetsContainer)
 |- add WidgetsManager class (tree of widgets, holds ownership of widget, draws widgets starting from root)
 |- add TexturesBuffer widget (holds textures that will be drawn at screen)
